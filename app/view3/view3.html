<h3>Getting a Waiver of the Requirements to File a Joint Petition</h3>
<p>If you are unable to file a joint petition with your U.S. spouse to remove the condition of 
your residency after getting your green card through adjustment; either because of divorce or 
because he or she died or refuses to cooperate, you must then file for a waiver of the requirement 
to file the joint petition.  This waiver will be granted in only three circumstances:</p>
<p> * You entered into a good faith marriage but the marriage is legally terminated (death or 
divorce)</p>
<p> * Your deportation will cause you extreme hardship and the marriage was originally 
entered into in good faith, or</p>
 <p>* You were battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by your U.S. spouse and the marriage 
was originally entered into good faith </p>
<p>Like the joint petition, an application for a waiver must ordinarily be filed before tour 
two-year conditional residency expires.  However, if you are forced to file late because you were 
abused, or for another good reason-especially a reason connected to your waiver request-USCIS 
may excuse the delay.</p>
<p>These types of cases are extremely difficult to establish, it is strongly recommended one 
consult with an immigration attorney to assist with this difficult process. Studies have shown that 
an applicant in these waiver cases has an extremely higher success rate when they retain a 
qualified immigration attorney to handle their waiver case. Jesse S. Atwal, Esq. can discuss the 
waiver procedure with you and tell you whether this is a viable option for your family.</p>

<h3>The N-336 and the dreaded marriage fraud allegation</h3>
<p>This blog is written for those who obtained their permanent green card after the 
conditional period and then filed for divorce.  Every month our law firm gets the 
following fact pattern from our potential clients:</p>
<p>I was going in for my Naturalization interview and after passing my test the interviewing 
officer started asking me about my prior marriage.  I did not know why they started 
asking detailed questions about my ex-spouse and the day I separated from them.  The 
officer asked detailed questions about my divorce and whether we had any children or 
assets together.  After the interview I was told that the USCIS would investigate my case 
further and eventually I got a denial letter alleging that I committed marriage fraud.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this is a fact pattern we see too often.  Since marriage fraud is a prevalent 
issue with the USCIS, this is a typical scenario that causes even long time green card 
holders to appear in Removal Proceedings.  If this fact pattern happened to you or you 
were involved in a similar situation, call our immigration attorney to discuss your case.  It 
is vital that if you got a denial letter that you resolve the fraud allegation (with an N-336 
filing) with as much evidence of a bona fide marriage with the assistance of an 
immigration attorney.  A simple Naturalization application could have far reaching 
consequences one could never have predicted.</p>

<h3>I-601A Provisional Waiver</h3>
<p>The absolute number one question I receive as an immigration attorney from my Mexican
clientele is:</p>
<p>“I am a U.S. Citizen but my spouse came here illegally several years ago.  How do I get 
them legal?”</p>
<p>The answer always was: you can apply for the family member now but they would have 
to go back to Ciudad Juarez, file a hardship waiver, and then wait for approximately six 
to eight months for approval.  However, if that hardship waiver is denied in Mexico, then 
the family member is stuck there and cannot sneak back or they will face a permanent 
bar.</p>
<p>Usually this quick conversation stopped about 70% of our potential clients from filing a 
hardship waiver.  The reasoning being that the stakes were too high to file for this waiver.  
Unless a family had a “clearly approvable” case and was all but guaranteed that the 
hardship waiver case would be approved, most people did not choose to file this waiver.</p>
<p>On January 2, 2013 the Secretary of State Janet Napolitano announced changes to the 
hardship waiver process that millions of families were waiting for.  Now one can file the 
waiver here in the United States and once approved, they can leave to their home country 
for an interview and be back in the United States a few weeks later.  Essentially, the 
major risk factor of being denied while back in the home country is eliminated.</p>
<p>Our law firm has successfully filed and obtained approvals of hardship waivers out of
Ciudad Juarez.  We are happy to hear that this process will allow families to finally move 
forward in obtaining status for their loved ones.  Since these hardship waivers take a lot 
of time and effort, I charge a one time consultation fee of $200 to determine whether you 
have a strong hardship case.  It is vital to have a licensed immigration attorney prepare 
your hardship waiver since most of the time you only get one bite at the apple.  Call us 
today for a consultation.</p>


<h3>Preference Relatives defined</h3>
<p>For immigrants that live outside of the United States, if you have a close family member 
in the United States, they may, if they are willing, be able to help you immigrate.  The 
most important aspect to consider is what relation they are to you.  The closer the 
relation, the more rights you have under immigration laws.</p>
<p>You may qualify for a green card through relatives if you fall into one of the following
categories:</p>
<p>*Immediate relative of a U.S. citizen<br>*Preference relative of a U.S. citizen or green card holder</p>
<p>You may qualify for a green card through relatives if you fall into one of the categories 
below, however, depending upon the category an immigrant may have to wait for many 
years before claiming a green card.</p>
<p>2nd Family Preference:<br>
2A:  Spouses and unmarried children (under 21 years old) of green card holders;<br>
2B:  Unmarried sons and daughters of green card holders, who are at least 21 years old</p>
<p>3rd Family Preference:<br>
Married children of a US citizen, any age</p>
<p>4th Family Preference:<br>
Sisters and brothers of US citizens, where the US citizens is at least 21 years old.</p>
<p>It is advisable one contact an immigration attorney in our law firm to determine the 
processing times and complicated procedural issues to obtain a green card for a family 
member.</p>


<h3>TOP TEN MYTHS STATED IN TIMESHARE PRESENTATIONS:</h3>
<p>In the last eight years, we have assisted a wide variety of clientele get out of their 
timeshare contracts.  Although our clients’ timeshare presentation stories differ, the 
myths and over-reaching assurances are always the same.  Here are the top ten statements 
made at timeshare presentations (and my responses) we hear at our law firm during our 
initial consultations:</p>
<p>10.  “The maintence fees generally stay the same and rarely go up.”<br>
-In my legal practice I have never seen maintence fees go down.  They without fail 
always go up even if you’ve owned the timeshare for several years.</p>
<p>9. “Booking your room is extremely easy.  We rarely have blackout dates”<br>
-The folks that book you for the timeshare presentation are a lot easier to get a hold of 
then the actual people that book your room.</p>
<p>8. “We know the 15-19% interest rate is expensive but your credit union will easily 
refinance the loan.”<br>
-Your credit union will most likely not finance an “asset” when you buy points and 
“own” a room with tens of thousands of other people</p>
<p>7. “The presentation will only last 90 minutes”<br>
-Usually our clients tell us the presentation ends up lasting over three hours at which 
point they are willing to sign anything for any price.</p>
<p>6.  “You will be able to resell or sublet the room to others and potentially make a 
profit every year”<br>
-Do the math first on how much your maintence fees were for the year plus the total 
payments made for the year on the timeshare contract.  If you’ve had the timeshare 
for more than five years, ask yourself how many years you’ve actually rented your 
timeshare to others?</p>
<p>5. “Buying a timeshare is the best real estate investment you can make for your 
family”<br>
-Do the math and then go on a legitimate travel website to see how much rooms go 
for during a week long vacation</p>
<p>4. “If you join a third party “travel club” you can bank your points and go to other 
destinations”<br>
-Most of the time to join this “club” it costs hundreds of dollars more.</p>
<p>3. “You can redeem your free trip with this voucher by calling this number”<br>
-Most of the time the number to call doesn’t work or you are then asked to upgrade 
the gift by paying more money</p>
<p>2. “This is a great asset to pass on to your children and heirs”<br>
-The only reason why this statement seems to be made is so your heirs can take on 
this debt in perpetuity.  Talk to a Wills and Trust attorney about this.</p>
<p>1. “If for some reason you want to change your mind about this timeshare contract 
or want to cancel, you have a legal right to cancel it within a state mandated 
timeframe”<br>
-Unfortunately if timeshare reps told you about this legal right; most people would 
exercise this clause right after they walk out of a high pressure timeshare sales pitch.  
Most of the time this statement is buried deep in the paperwork that most people 
don’t take the time to read.</p>

<h3>How to Get out of your Timeshare Contract</h3>
<p>Over the last eight years I’ve been flooded with potential clients that want to “get rid of 
their timeshare”.  Even our most affluent clients that are sophisticated investors fall into 
these timeshare traps and do not know what to do after they sign a timeshare contract.</p>
<p>From my experience, it is obvious that timeshare companies prey on people with good 
credit and solid financial backgrounds.  They pull the bait and switch trick by enticing 
people with anything from free dinners, shows, free trips, or appliances.  (We heard one 
timeshare company offering free toasters).  Trust us; your “free” prize will be one of the 
most expensive purchases you will ever make in your life!</p>
<p>Once you walk into the presentation, the timeshare salesman will try to sell you a 
package at whatever price you can afford.  It will be guaranteed to be on the most high-
pressured sales pitch you’ll ever experience with promises of how it is a great investment 
for you and your kids.  Here’s the truth and example that we give our clients:</p>
<p>For the purchase price you just paid for the timeshare and future maintence fees: you 
could have booked the Presidential Suite in whatever hotel they’re offering you, order 10 
cases of fine champagne, take a bath in it, and it will still cost you less money than 
paying for a timeshare.  The unfortunate part is, most people are forced to quickly sign 
the timeshare contract without reading it and they do not bother to do the math.</p>
<p>Most companies have figured out that people are sick and tired of the timeshare craze, so 
there are plenty of timeshare buy-back programs.  From what our clients have told us, 
they are also scams.  The only companies that are worth your money are the ones that 
don’t charge an up-front fee and actually pay you only after they sell your timeshare.  
Our law firm has heard excellent feedback from a company called “Preferred Timeshare 
Resales” and owner Karen Phelan.  Every other company, be careful if the program asks 
for an upfront fee of $500 to $3,500.</p>
<p>Feel free to give me a call and I can discuss with you the options you have to get rid of 
your timeshare.  Our law firm does not specialize in timeshare resales but we have 
handled numerous cases where we have terminated our clients’ timeshare contracts.  We 
just ask that you are not emotionally attached
back once we initiate your case.</p>

<h3>DON’T BE AFRAID OF TIMESHARE COMPANIES COLLECTION THREATS</h3>
<p>Lots of times I get calls from potential clients after they receive an intimidating collection
letter from their timeshare company.  Usually our clients stop making payments after they 
get fed up with the increasing maintence fee and extreme difficulty in booking a date.  
(You would think after paying thousands of dollars for the timeshare, booking a date 
would be a bit easier.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when the payments stop, the collection letters start pouring in.  Legally 
speaking, most of the collection letters are correct in that you may be on the hook for 
damages for breaching your timeshare contract.  (Remember, the 30 page contract you 
signed and initialed in a hurry in order to get your free prize?)  Over the last couple of 
years, our law firm has started firing back at these collection efforts and terminating the 
timeshare contracts.</p>
<p>In every contract there is an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  This is a 
covenant of fairness and equity implied in all contracts for liability purposes, and this 
covenant is breached when there is “conscious and reckless disregard” to the rights of the 
contracting party.  Jenkins v. Family Health Program, 214 Cal.App.3d 400 (1989).  We 
believe the timeshare companies breach this covenant every time they modify the 
contract by increasing the maintence fees, overbook the timeshare, or force you to “bank” 
your points with an unknown company that charges you more user fees.</p>
<p>Don’t let these collection letters scare you into paying more money into this terrible 
investment.  On numerous occasions we speak to the timeshare company’s legal 
department and to avoid costly litigation we will try to resolve your timeshare case.  Call 
me today to discuss your legal options.  The consultation is free and you will speak to me 
directly.</p>
