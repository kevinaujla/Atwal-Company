    <h3>PERSONAL INJURY</h3>

    <p>At the law firm of Atwal & Company, we are here to help you through the traumatic experience of a personal injury.  We will explain the legal process to you in terms of procedure, typical settlement times, costs and the value of your case so you can make informed decisions.  If you have been injured by one of the following accidents, please contact us today to discuss your legal rights:</p>

    <h4>Auto Accidents</h4>

    <p>Auto accident victims can suffer the effects of their injuries for years, and many will need long term care.  Whether your accident involves a car, motorcycle, bicycle, truck, commercial vehicle, or a boat, our personal injury team will help you receive the settlement you deserve.</p>

    <p>At our law firm we understand that your primary concern is to ensure your medical bills are paid, and that you receive a fair value of your damaged property.  Additionally, we will help you determine if you have suffered further damages that may need to be compensated.  Such damages may include:  compensation for pain and suffering as a result of the accident and lost wages from time missed at your place of employment.</p>

    <p>If you or someone you love has been the victim of car accident, it is important to contact a personal injury attorney as soon as possible to discuss your rights.  California law only allows a law suit to be brought within a certain amount of time following the car accident.  Therefore, it is essential that you make a determination of your legal rights within this time frame.  </p>

    <h4>Trip and Fall</h4>

    <p>If you have been injured in a trip and fall accident, it will likely be in your best interest to contact our personal injury attorney, Jesse S. Atwal. A trip and fall accident generally means that you fell and injured yourself on someone else’s property due to the fault of the property owner.</p>


    <p>To receive compensation for your damages in a trip and fall case, you will generally have to prove that the property owner was negligent in maintaining their property.  Property owners have the legal duty to keep their premises reasonably safe for visitors and others lawfully on the property. These cases can be tricky to litigate since the insurance companies know that most juries do not like to award Plaintiff’s a verdict in their favor even though they suffered substantial injuries.  In 2014, we took a trip and fall case to trial in Sacramento County and received a six figure jury verdict with an 11 to 1 award in our client’s favor.  Our law firm has no hesitations in taking your trip and fall case to trial; of course there are risks and rewards for pushing a case to trial so it is important to consult with an attorney to get an accurate case evaluation.</p>

    <h4>Pedestrian Injury</h4>

    <p>When cars collide with pedestrians, there is high potential for serious injury. Pedestrian/motor vehicle accidents are a serious problem throughout the world.  Pedestrians are usually unprotected unlike occupants of motor vehicles that are equipped with seatbelts and airbags. In addition, the impact of a large and heavy vehicle can be significant and can result in severe trauma. Even if you’re not sure you need an attorney for your car, it doesn’t hurt to contact one immediately after your pedestrian accident. We offer a free case review. We also do not charge a fee until your case is settled. You will not pay anything until you win your case.</p>


    <h4>Wrongful death</h4>

    <p>Wrongful death is a form of damaged that a victim's family members can seek financial recovery. Under established case law, a person who is negligent or intentionally hurts someone else can be held financially liable for that action.  If the victim lives, the victim is able to sue to recover for his lost wages, medical bills, and pain and suffering.  If the victim dies, the family members of the victim are allowed to sue for a wrongful death claim.</p>

    <p>Wrongful death lawsuits can occur in medical malpractice cases, in a car accident case, in a dog bite, or commercial truck accident.  Our law firm is equipped to handle any of these situations so your family can receive financial compensation for your suffering.</p>

    <h3>IMMIGRATION LAW</h3>

    <p>For decades, people have immigrated to the United States with the purpose of improving the lives of their families. We work closely with clients to develop strategies that best fit their needs. Our goal is to simplify a complex immigration system and provide excellent legal service.  There are two main areas of immigration law we specialize in:</p>

    <h4>Family Based Immigration</h4>

    <p>There are many ways to obtain legal immigrant or non-immigrant status, permanent residency and citizenship in the United States. We assist U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents to petition for their spouses, fiancés, parents, children and siblings. Our law firm has also represented students and professors on temporary visas, appeared at fraud interviews for green card cases, and file appeals with the USCIS if your green card or citizenship cases are being denied.  We strive to keep families together and simplify the complicated family-based immigration process.</p>

    <h4>Deportation Defense</h4>

    <p>When families face the potential deportation of a loved one, Atwal & Company is a trusted source of legal advocacy.  Our firm has successfully resolved a range of complicated immigration cases including those involving criminal records, visa fraud, and waivers. We represent both detained and non-detained clients in immigration proceedings.  We represent detained clients in ICE custody to quickly and efficiently obtain immigration bonds so they can reunite with their families and fight their immigration case without being in jail.</p>

    <h3>TIMESHARES</h3>

    <a href="#/Blog">Read my timeshare blogs here</a>

    <p>Over the last eight years we have represented many clients that want to “get rid of their timeshare.” Even our most affluent clients that are sophisticated investors fall into these timeshare traps and do not know what to do after they sign a timeshare contract.</p>

    <p>The timeshare contracts are written by lawyers that obviously only favor the timeshare company and are usually iron clad.  Most timeshare buyers do not bother to read the 10 to 20-page contract since they are purposefully forced to quickly sign the document in order to ensure the buyer doesn’t make an informed decision.  Most timeshare insiders will tell you that 100% of their sales happen right after the presentation since most people are not given the opportunity to “think about it”.</p>

    <p>If you have purchased a timeshare and come to the realization that it has been one of the worst financial decisions you have made, call our law firm at (916) 359-5000 to review your timeshare contract.  There may be options for you and you need to consider whether you can mitigate your financial losses and consider terminating your timeshare contract.</p>
