<p>Jesse S. Atwal grew up in Tracy California on the family’s 100 acre alfalfa farm and then moved to Merced to work and live on the family’s almond and peach orchards.  It is through these childhood experiences on the farm that he learned the value of hard work and could sympathize with their hard working laborers the struggle migrant families face everyday.</p>

<p>After graduating from the University of California, Davis and then law school, he immediately started working for various law firms that specialized in civil litigation, personal injury, land use planning, and immigration law.  After passing the bar, he worked for eight years at a full service law firm gaining valuable trial experience in civil litigation and personal injury cases.  Not forgetting his family’s immigrant background he single handedly grew his former law firm’s immigration practice as one of the most successful immigration law practices in Sacramento.</p>

<p>Mr. Atwal also had the privilege of representing seriously injured clients throughout the entire spectrum of personal injury litigation. Throughout his legal career he has obtained several large settlements on behalf of injured clients.  Over the years, Jesse Atwal has helped his clients, in every imaginable context, in cases such as Vehicle Accidents, Wrongful Death cases, Brain Injuries, Animal Bites, Trip and Fall accidents, Premises Liability, Burn Injuries, and other types of Personal Injury cases.</p>

<p>He currently manages his company’s almond orchards and real estate development holdings.  He enjoys challenging himself in half marathons and going to U.C. Davis sporting events with his two children and lovely wife, Dr. Amy Atwal.
